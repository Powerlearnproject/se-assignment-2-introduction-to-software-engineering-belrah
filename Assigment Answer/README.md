Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions: Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.


Questions 1: Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality software systems. it is also the design, development, testing, deployment and maintainance of software products. examples of these products includes digital products like websites, mobile apps and desktop applications etc.
Traditional Programming on the other hand is the process of writing out explicit instructions, one step at a time, for the computer to follow. Imagine it like writing a detailed recipe for a computer to execute.
The major difference is while software engineering handles the projects as a whole the traditional programming focuses on specific aspect of the functionality.


Question2: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

the following are the different phases of software development life circle:
1. Requirement Phase: this is the phase where informations about user needs and system requirements are gathered and documented.
2. Design Phase: in this phase, a high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are crafted 
3. Implementation Phase: writing of codes and building of the softwares in accordance to the design specifications are done.
4. Testing Phase: Various tests are conducted to ensure the developed software meets quality standard and functional requirements
5. Deploment Phase: This is thephase were the softwares are released to the users or customers for use.
6. Maintainace Phase: Providing support updates and enhancement to the software after deployment.


Question3: Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
